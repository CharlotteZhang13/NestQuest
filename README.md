# Introduction
NestQuest is a fun programming interface for kids that mimics MIT Media Lab's Scratch. One new feature we've added is the multi-person editing room, allowing users to collaborate with co-workers in real time by sharing a generated code. Editor-wise it provides a block-based interface, supporting multiple nested while's, if's, and for's, undoing, redoing changes, and a variable system, just like Scratch. Visual-wise it involves the classic orange Scratch cat, supporting translation, rotations, and texts.

# Tutorial

### 3. Enter "node index.js" in the terminal
### 4. Open the web page "localhost:3010" ("3010" can be substituted with the number that appears in the terminal when it starts running)
